01.7g.	If a card or effect that changes the number of Normal/Tribute Summons in a turn is activated after a player has already performed Normal/Tribute Summons during that turn, the Normal/Tribute Summons performed before the effect are counted towards the new value.

01.7s.	If a card of effect states in its text “immediately after this effect resolves, you can [Normal/Tribute] Summon 1 […] monster.”, then that is an effect that makes a player perform an additional Normal/Tribute Summon immediately after that effect resolves.
